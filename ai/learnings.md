# What is AI ?

- What is AI ?
- What is difference between AI & ML ?
- What do you understand when you think of the word ML ?
- Application you are using that employs AI
  - FB automatic photo tagging
  - Google photos search
  - Auto complete in phones/google search
- What is deep learning ?

# What is Computer Vision ?

- Applications using Computer Vision

  - Auto driven cars
  - Image classification
  - Medical image Analysis

- Library - open cv (Python / C++)

# How ML works ?

- Machine learns in a similar model like humans - Analogy
- What really happens ?

  Remember the equation: `y = mx + c`

  **During training:**

  y, x is known, machine learns the values of m (weights) and c (constant) by adjusting

  **During testing and prediction:**

  x, m and c are known, y is unknown which can be computed based no the above equation

# Kinds of Machine Learning

- Supervised - Ex: Image classification
- Unsupervised - Ex: Clustering/ Grouping related item into a category
- Semi-supervised - Combination of supervised and unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement - Ex: Playing chess

# Types of ML algorithm:

- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- K-Means clustering
- Support vector machines (SVM)
- Neural networks

# Deep Learning

- Subset of ML
- Trains on millions of data
- Multi layer neural network
- Requires huge computing powers (GPU)

# ML Libraries

- scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- PyTorch
- Theano
- Keras (Higher level abstraction)

# Other libraries to know

- numpy (must)
- pandas (if you are working on non-images side of ML)
- opencv for python (if working on Computer Vision)
